# Corona weather effects analyses
Analysis of the weather in the Netherlands during the 2020 corona crisis. 

Inspired by this [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/418601a) I was curious if there was any effect on the weather of the reduced air traffic.

I analyzed data from the Netherlands and didn't really find a large effect for the temperature differences as they did in the article. However, I did find that it was awfully sunny!
